              <p>
                On a dark cold winter, a 16 y/o girl named Ruby was lying
                motionlessly in an abandoned house. Her face was very pale and
                was on the brink of death. Ruby was abandoned by her father in
                the streets when she was 6. Ever since then, she had been living
                homeless. Suddenly, a boy, around her age appeared next to her
                out of nowhere. His eyes sparkled brightly and beautifully like
                a blue galaxy. She couldn't hear his footsteps as she was born
                deaf.
              </p>
              <div class="wrap-collabsible">
                <input id="collapsible" class="toggle" type="checkbox" />
                <label for="collapsible" class="h2 lbl-toggle"
                  >Continue...</label
                >
                <div class="collapsible-content">
                  <div class="content-inner">
                    <p>
                      That boy, later named Aqua, opened her mouth and dropped a
                      pill in it. A few seconds later, her limbs gained strength
                      and she rose slowly. When compared to her life, Ruby was
                      more elated when she could hear sounds for the first ever.
                      Aqua invited her to live in his world where shelter and
                      warm food will be provided. Ruby could not agree more.
                      Aqua's world was a land where magic lived.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                      Two years had passed. Ruby had never felt pure joy like
                      this. Every day, Aqua would cook gourmet dishes for Ruby
                      and even taught her to cook using his magical method. One
                      day, while Ruby and Aqua were harvesting vegetables in an
                      open field, a large beastly creature with sharp fangs
                      appeared behind Ruby. Ruby was immediately taken up the
                      air with force and thrown into its mouth. Suddenly a quick
                      whooshing arrow was sent flying into its eyes. Aqua jumped
                      into its mouth to save Ruby who was stuck in its teeth.
                      Aqua finally told Ruby the truth that if he didn't steal
                      the medicine made from the beasts' eggs, the beast
                      wouldn't hunt her down.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                      The creature wailed and ran angrily towards a nearby
                      ocean. It plunged deep into the waters together with Ruby
                      and Aqua. Both of them fought the crashing waves futilely
                      to reach the surface. Thinking fast, Aqua created a portal
                      in the water and pushed Ruby into it. Ruby was puzzled
                      about why Aqua didn't follow together. Later, Ruby
                      realised that it would be the last time they'll ever see
                      each other. A split of seconds later, Ruby found herself
                      back in that old abandoned building where she first met
                      Aqua.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                      Ever since Ruby took that medicine, her eyes turned purple
                      galaxy-looking like Aqua. Tears streamed down her sparkly
                      eyes. She felt like she has been in a very long sweet
                      dream. She got up but felt confused about why there was a
                      sharp pang of sadness in her heart as if she had lost
                      someone or something precious to her.
                      <br />
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Ruby continued living nomadically from place to place. One
                      day, she walked past an old lady who struggled in her food
                      business stall. Out of reflex, Ruby walked up to her as if
                      she knew the solution to help her. The owner was surprised
                      as Ruby managed to attract 3 times her usual customers in
                      a day. At first, no one wanted to purchase her food. But,
                      she did not give up easily as she had a strong faith in
                      that secret recipe. And indeed, customers slowly liked her
                      dishes, commenting the food tasted surreal as if mixed
                      with magical substance. The owner trusted Ruby a lot so
                      she gave up her business to Ruby.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                      Due to its unusually high popularity, Ruby's small stall
                      had grown into a fine dining restaurant just within a
                      year. She named her restaurant yume, meaning dream in
                      Japanese. Up till this day, she dreamed and hoped to meet
                      that special person again.
